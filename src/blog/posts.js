      <p>
        The whole reason why the numerical system running the entirety of humankind is built around powers of 10 is none other than that humans have 10 fingers to count on. It's all just PR. But to increase the rightmost digit 0 through 9 (then carry over and repeat) is not the only way to count. The binary system expresses just as rich a world as the decimal one with only 2 digits. Hex with 16.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you don't know how to change bases, you should learn. Most of us were taught how all the way back in school—though, more likely than not, only very briefly. Definitely too briefly to learn The Lesson: that changing bases is not merely the ability to reorganise representations but a lot more profound skill to navigate problem spaces that are deeply unfamiliar and uncomfortably abstract.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's a skill so fascinating that it's inspired art. If you haven't watched Arrival, again, you should. It's a film that does what good sci-fis do, which is pick a pillar human society takes for granted and reimagine the world without it. What if the medium humans use to talk to one another is just one of many. What if language were not linear. (Sign language could teach this same lesson, by the way, but let's not go down that rabbit hole.)
      </p>

      <p>
        The thing is that the ability to change bases is not just a nice-to-have anymore. It's the bare minimum to survive in the future. Want a real-life example? Quantum computing. To even begin to grasp quantum computing, you must be able to imagine a world where you can perform linear transformations with the snap of your fingers and where basic arithmetic takes up half your CPU (QPU, whatever).
      </p>

      <p>
        No, wait, I can do you one better: AI. I say there is no such thing as "having a feel" for LLMs. It's all just the capacity to switch bases and imagine what the world would be like if all you knew about it came from eavesdropping on human conversations about their experiences of the world. The whole field of AIS is built upon the question of: If you learnt about humanity from what humans have found words for, what wouldn't you get right?
      </p>

      <p>
        (For what it's worth I honestly think that if more folx fell for my change of bases propaganda, it'd solve an awful lot of society's issues and "issues", too. Not at all saying different people(s) aren't entitled to their own axiological grounding, but it wouldn't hurt if everyone stopped solving problems by projecting their own value base onto all problems in all contexts all the time.)
      </p>

      <p>
        My point is: solving problems you can easily grasp is not good enough anymore. The literal survival skill for the present century is the ability to step out of your comfort bubble and look at the world from a place different to the one you've grown so accustomed to. Too bad too few have mastered it yet. The good news is: everyone can work on it. If you're looking for ways to best prepare for the future, this is how.

    title: 'An Unnecessarily Practical Guide to Thriving at Top Universities as a FGLI Student',
    date: 'July 2025',
    content: `
      <p><em>The term First-Generation Low-Income (FGLI) students refers to a group of students who are the first in their immediate families to attend college or come from low-income backgrounds.</em></p>
      
      <p>At around this time four years ago, I had just graduated from high school and was slowly packing up my whole life in the famous one suitcase to move across the ocean and pursue my (very generously sponsored) Ivy League degree. As soon as the school year kicked off though, it felt like there was a thick-ass glass wall between me and the university experience I was looking forward to: I was at a great university, but it didn't feel like the resources were available to me. There was so much student life happening, but none of it felt like it was inviting me to have fun.</p>
      
      <p>Now it was not the Imposter Syndrome everyone kept warning me against—that I had been introduced to from high school and it just wasn't <em>it</em>. It took me a while to figure out that I simply felt awfully disconnected from all these students who asked for regrades like the staff worked for them and who joined events as if on a personal invite. They all grew up overhearing their parents discuss university years. They may even have had someone splurge on their education before. They came to a top-notch university like it was at least normal or even expected. Not all of us did.</p>
      
      <p>This post wasn't written to mourn the resources I myself didn't have, nor to make recommendations on what institutions and families should and should not do to address the gaps between first- and continuing-generation students. It will also most certainly not contribute to fixing the status quo. This is a heartless, instrumental, solution-oriented post. A battle plan. It's to describe the reality of navigating the Ivy League—or any good school for that matter—as a FGLI student and pass on hacks I had to learn the hard way so that whoever reads this doesn't have to.</p>

      <h2>Observation no. 1: You'll Be So Risk-Averse You'll Feel Insane.</h2>
      
      <p>As a FGLI student, you know that you're a gem. Look at how few students like you got in; statistically speaking, you'll feel like there's no place for you. You'll feel like you have no margin for error. You'll refuse to step out of your comfort zone into the learning zone just to minimise the chances. There are two issues to this: (1) avoiding experiences robs you off growth, and (2) emergencies happen even if you turtle up. You are not better off running from the storm. Prepare for it. The best way to do so is to accept that when life happens, it's no longer practice; it's game time.</p>
      
      <p>This means you're going to <strong>locate safety nets before university even begins</strong>. And I don't mean 'look them up online' (though that's a fair start). I mean stalk them, go tour relevant offices, pay attention in orientation. Many universities offer emergency funding, insurance coverage, tutoring services, free counselling, or rental computers. You want to know exactly how the process works: What is the scope of support? How do you request it? How long is the wait? Aim to minimise all friction. And prepare to get over yourself and ask for support when you need it.</p>

      <h2>Observation no. 2: Money Will *Feel* Tighter.</h2>

      <p>Your university may hold personal finance workshops that will tell you to just sTiCk to tHE bUDgEt, and they'll feel kind of useless because you already know that simply 'sticking to the budget' won't be enough. You need that feeling to stop sitting in the back of your mind, the feeling that a single thing gone wrong will cause the rest of your world fall like dominoes, and that you'll drown before the above-mentioned safety nets even kick in. Safety nets are designed to prevent you from <em>falling through</em>, they won't prevent you from worrying about <em>falling down</em> to begin with.</p>
      
      <p>Now you can either let financial anxiety eat into the time you won't have, or you can <strong>come up with a number</strong>. For some, this number is derived from the expected cost of replacing a broken device, and, for some, from the cost of a last-minute flight home. In general, it should be a function of 'What will it take to contain a disaster?'. Once you have a number, you pile up cash. You'll have to say no to a few things for a brief time period to get there, but you'll be able to prioritise classwork over working out of necessity for the rest of your studies.</p>

      <h2>Observation no. 3: Your Job-Hunting Will Look Different.</h2>

      <p>Some of your peers will have watched their families grow successful businesses, shake hands with well-placed people. Later on, even if they're looking to land a job someplace with no connections, they'll still know their way around accomplished people better. They'll be more native in the language of the right… class. Meanwhile, you've been ripped out of your community, made the (brave) choice to leave everything and everyone you knew behind to chase a better life. Alas, few of your prior experiences and connections will help you out.</p>
      
      <p>Yet they've shaped you into the person you've become. You may forever speak with a little bit of an 'accent' out in the big world, and you may not have had the privilege of accepting unpaid internships to boost your resume because you needed to make ends meet first. However, you are tougher, more attuned now. Capitalise on it. Network. <strong>Tell your story.</strong> You'll still have to knock on twice as many doors as some, but all you need is one person to notice the aptitude—the promise—your professional history may not advertise that loud, and you'll take it from there.</p>

      <h2>Observation no. 4: You'll have little to no support from home.</h2>

      <p>And I don't mean financial support. I mean no one will tell you how to make professional connections, no one will give you a second opinion on coursework. In fact, most people where you come from likely won't understand what it is that you study. And not only will you have to find someone new to turn to, you'll <em>also</em> have to set a boundary with your family and figure out a way to not feel shit about it. They'll want to support you even if they don't know how, talk to you even if there's nothing to talk about. And you know they mean well, but, some days, you'll just be busy.</p>
      
      <p>You can set a boundary, but boundaries only work if you stick with them. This means that if you say that you can't chat on such and such day and your younger sister still spams you memes, swallow the bitter pill and silence your notifications. Call back when you can. 'How dare you?' <strong>Simply because you know your needs better than anyone.</strong> (By the way, this is not to discourage you from talking to your folks—this is a reminder that prioritising them should be a choice and not the default.) In this stage of your life, you'll need your world to revolve around you.</p>

      <h2>Observation no. 5: Either you game the system, or it'll chew you up.</h2>
      
      <p>Now this is where I personally learnt my hardest lessons. I completely misunderstood that a university is not just a body of knowledge, it's a system. For some classes it matters a great deal that you get along with the instructor, for some it matters less. Sometimes it's better to take longer to submit more quality work even if there is a late submission penalty, sometimes you should turn in whatever you have even if it's subpar. There are too many aspects to this, and you'll have to figure most by yourself.</p>
      
      <p>I can leave you with two unsolicited pieces of advice that I remember wishing someone had told me, though. (1) <strong>Your work will be assessed by humans and humans make mistakes</strong>. Go ask about that half-a-point you believe you should've got! On a five-point quiz, that's 10% of your grade. Even on a hundred-point exam, 0.5% can drag your whole grade down. (2) <strong>Easy and fun classes go first, hard and annoying classes can wait</strong>. This is because you'll have a hard time landing your first internship as is, and a spotless record will only help you out.<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup></p>

      <hr>

      <p>Two concluding notes: first, only when I got around to writing this post did I realise that I actually had very few acquaintances whose family wouldn't be at least university-educated. Once again, this is not to say that I felt alone in any way—I have experienced very quality connections all throughout university. This is to say that maybe some of the above would have come to me a lot quicker had my friend group consisted of different demographics. In other words, in case it wasn't obvious, take all I wrote with a pinch of salt and adjust for personal circumstances.</p>
      
      <p>Second (and more important), though much of the above makes it look like a failure factory, the Ivy League in particular actually comes with a snapton of opportunities, many of which will be well available to FGLI students. Most universities will have excellent study abroad programmes, summer travel placements, even international for-credit courses, much of which will even be subsidised. The whole point is: understand where you come from but never let it stand in the way of where you're headed. You have a place in the big world, don't pass up your chance to find it.</p>

        All our troubles, we'll lay to rest, and<br>
        We'll wish we could come back to these days.<br>
        <em>— Rudimental, These Days</em>
      </blockquote>

      <p><strong>The Perfect Night.</strong> Let me just point out that I never meant to get this close. All I wanted was to catch a ferry to Ward's Island and take some cheap pictures with Toronto's nighttime skyline, but the ferry wouldn't come, so I turned around and walked up to Nathan Phillips Square, only to find out that they rented ice skates for $10. How could I say no to that?</p>

      <p>That a girl could hockey stop impressed all the boys at the ice rink, though I didn't care. I already had a date. I said I wanted dinner and you said okay, but the nearby markets were too crowded. We snuck out and found ourselves this table under the fairy lights, and you whispered to me to get this food-truck poutine. Though I was sceptical at first, my heart melted alongside the cheese curds.</p>

      <p>A couple of Indian kids asked to join, for there was nowhere else left to sit. They talked me into trying paneer sometime, and I made their eyes light up by mentioning that their mother tongue was kind of dope. By then, my phone had run out of charge, but it didn't matter because I knew my way back to my hotel room. I got strangely comfortable with being all by myself in the middle of a big city, in the middle of a splendid frozen night.</p>

      <p><strong>Mastering Waterbending.</strong> Fine nightlife is not all there is to you, though, is it? I hated that Niagara Falls had a bit too many flashing neon signs and only ghosts to advertise to, but the ambient sound I heard after my headset fell off drew an unforeseen awed 'wow' from my lips. Note to self: the power of water strikes the ear much more clearly than it does the eye.</p>

      <p>I climbed the fence and had this passing German tourist take a few borderline illegal pictures. For the record: I didn't realise it was illegal at the time of taking the pictures, but chances are that even if I did know, I would've done it anyway. For a brief moment I felt like I was bending water at the edge of that cliff, and it brought this cheeky grin to my face that I hadn't experienced in a while.</p>

      <p><strong>The Wall.</strong> Once I returned to the city, just before I headed to the airport, you grabbed my hand and pulled me to this alley covered in graffiti. You knew that it'd remind me of this street artist I used to know, didn't you? You knew I needed to sit through my own grief over lost friendships, so you escorted me to a nearby bench and had the northern breeze wipe away my tears. But you also knew to keep your distance. I already had a home, after all.</p>

      <p><strong>Home.</strong> You left me alone but not lonely, although you knew I'd be gone soon. I didn't cry on the plane. I cuddled the plushie racoon I bought for the Boy and thought to myself that I now understand why he remembers you with so much admiration, almost longing. Hey Canada, you made me love you more than Toronto loves hockey—and that is a lot. Are we going to see each other again or was this just a drive-by?</p>

    title: 'A Continuing List of Grounding Fermi Problems (and how to solve them)',
    date: 'August 2025',
    content: `
      <p>A <em>Fermi estimation</em> question is a question that can be solved by combining smaller pieces of information to arrive at rough estimate of larger, otherwise difficult-to-estimate quantities. A "good" Fermi question (and I'd like to thank Eric for this definition) is one where "a reasonable human can be >1 order of magnitude (= multiple of 10) off". Below I show some original solutions to what I consider solid—and quite insightful—Fermi problems + the summary of general tips at the end.</p>

      <h2>Q#1: On an average day in 2025, how many flights worldwide land safely?</h2>

      <p>~5 billion passengers fly per year <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travel-truths/how-many-planes-are-there-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[1]</a>, which is ~13,700,000 per day. Now smaller planes like Boeing 737 used on domestic flights typically hold 150-200 passengers and planes like Boeing 777 used on long haul flights hold 200-400 passengers at a time. However, it is also reasonable to assume that this curve is skewed by the vast majority of short-haul flights <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Flight-length-and-duration-for-short-haul-and-long-haul-flights_tbl7_267927654" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[2]</a> as well as that most flights are only ~90% full at best, and so let's count with an average 135 passengers per flight. When 13,700,000 passengers get divided by 135, we arrive at ~101,500, only a few thousands away from the actual answer of <strong>103,573</strong> <a href="https://www.oag.com/airline-frequency-and-capacity-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[3]</a>.</p>

      <h2>Q#2: As of 2024, what was the value, in USD, of the total outstanding federal student loan balance in the US?</h2>

      <p>The USA has a population of ~340 million people. Assuming that roughly every seventh American has student loan debt, we have 48 million people in debt. If we assume an average debt of $40,000 (balancing the overwhelming majority of local colleges with only a few thousands in tuition and living costs per semester with fewer but disproportionately more expensive private colleges and graduate degrees), we arrive at ~1.94 trillion, pennies away from the actual answer of <strong>1.7 trillion</strong> <a href="https://educationdata.org/student-loan-debt-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[4]</a>.</p>

      <h2>Q#3: How many trees are in the Amazon rainforest?</h2>

      <p>We know that the US have an area of almost 10 million square kilometres. Now the Amazon Rainforest spans across much of the northern belt of South America, which can be reasonably estimated to be more than a half but less than the full size of the US, let's call it 7.5 million square kilometres (it's actually a bit less than that, around 6.7 million<a href="https://www.wwf.org.uk/learn/fascinating-facts/amazon#:~:text=1.,the%20side%20of%20the%20UK!" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[5]</a>; also, it may appear that the >50% size of the US is a bit ambitious, but it's important to note that the US are a bit further away from the equator, making the area seem bigger than it realistically is. >50% is a safe estimate.). Let's say that one tree needs 25 square metres of living space (my estimate is between 1 and 5 metres on the x and y axes, but I'm choosing the pessimistic end to compensate for bodies of water, rocky areas, and other spaces where trees may not grow); this means that ~40,000 trees will fit in 1 square kilometre. 7.5 million square kilometres times ~40,000 trees brings us to 300 billion trees, which is relatively close to the actual <strong>340 billion</strong> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06820-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[6]</a>.</p>

      <h2>Q#4: How many people became the citizens of the US by naturalisation in 2024?</h2>

      <p>The US has ~340 million citizens, of which 10 to 15% can be reasonably assumed to be foreign-born (it's 15.8% <a href="https://cis.org/Report/ForeignBorn-Number-and-Share-US-Population-AllTime-Highs-January-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[7]</a>). May the average life expectancy in the US be ~70 years (77<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-expectancy.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[8]</a>, whoops). This means that these 34 to 51 million people could've become the US citizens any time between now and 52 years ago (as the eligibility for citizenship acquisition by naturalisation is only allowed for 18+<a href="https://www.usa.gov/naturalization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[9]</a>). This brings us to ~650,000 to ~980,000 citizens per year (naively assuming uniform distribution, which has actually risen significantly over the past few decades). Anyway, the answer of <strong>818,500</strong><a href="https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship-resource-center/naturalization-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[10]</a> is within that range.</p>

      <h2>Q#5: How many people in the US speak Native North American languages at home?</h2>

      <p>Once again, the US has ~340 million citizens. We can reasonably assume that, of these ~340 million, only 1 to 2% are of the Indigenous heritage<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[11]</a>. That said, >90% are likely schooled or employed in the English-speaking environment and are therefore disincentivised from building homes and relationships within their linguistic communities. By doing a pessimistic estimate of the number of Native American people and an optimistic estimate of the ratio that continues to use Indigenous languages in daily life, we arrive at 340,000—not too far off the actual <strong>372,000</strong><a href='https://languagemagazine.com/census-shows-native-languages-count/' target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">[12]</a>.</p>

      <hr>

      <p><strong>General Thoughts:</strong> Beside the general advice of "break down each question into more manageable subproblems" and "use information you know to estimate a range of information you don't know", I find it quite helpful to work with endpoints of estimated ranges and balance out the number of optimistic and pessimistic values per chain of thought (rather than work with the averages of ranges). Suppose you're working out the value of x from the estimated ranges for subproblems y and z: select one endpoint for y according to relevant externalities, but make a conscious choice to go with the other endpoint when unsure on z. Helps offset compounding errors and prevents systemic bias.</p>

      <p>Got any Fermi problems you believe could fit this collection? Send them my way and I may work them out!</p>

    content: `
      <p>I hear people complain that telling kids to merely 'say sorry' when they wrong someone is not teaching them actual empathy, but I think the overarching issue is that they never learn to resolve conflict—only to handle it, at best. Now I've never studied conflict resolution itself, but I have read my fair share of papers about the human mind, which I've found helpful in connecting the dots in real-world scenarios. My today's contribution is a few tips on resolving conflict that help me resolve ~90% of my problems, most of which work across settings—from work and friendships, to dating and family. Hope some of it helps.</p>

      <h2>No. 1: Assume Good Intentions.</h2>

      <p>What if arguments weren't competitive but rather collaborative games? The thing is, in general, few people enter arguments with actual ill intentions. I mean, <em>very</em> few. Some do; we normally identify them with subgenres of anti-social personality disorders, and there's a grand total of ~1%<a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2022/03/ce-corner-psychopathy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">[1]</a> of them amongst us (out of which many are already locked up in prison and/or otherwise institutionalised). It's generally safe to assume that your conversation partners have at least justifiable and potentially altruistic intentions. With that in mind, a lot of fights will de-escalate by getting everyone's on the same page.</p>

      <p>To do so, look for a crux: Why is it that they believe they're right? Is this a fair game regarding the information available? (By which I also mean: Have you shared relevant information including but not limited to feelings and experiences, and have <em>you</em> shared it using language accessible to the other party?) If you're even on information, maybe your respective values or priorities differ? You could throw the phrase around as is, but I swear there's something contagiously peaceful about being able to genuinely say, 'I see where you're coming from,' and your partner will notice.</p>

      <h2>No. 2: Double-Click on Your Memories.</h2>

      <p>A lot of the time people are willing to burn bridges, it is because they're CONVINCED they remember exactly how an event in question happened ("you did Y but we agreed to do X", "you said Z", etc.). The issue is that your conversation partner is likely just as CONVINCED they also remember exactly what happened (and their version still somehow doesn't match yours). This is because the human memory sucks. We remember what didn't happen and we forget what did. We fill in the blanks. We "skim read" the past. Our brains are designed to be consistent and helpful, who needs accurate?</p>

      <p>To tackle this, simply assume a margin of error for your own memory and cut some slack to that of your conversation partner. (If you find yourself dismissing too many of your own memories too often, it may point to other toxic patterns, but it's generally rational to revisit memories with a degree of scepticism.) Concurrently, even if you somehow "have a screenshot" proving you're right, you need to note that you've just pulled a rug from underneath your conversation partner's feet—they had built a world around memories they reasonably assumed to be true. Just give them a minute man.</p>

      <h2>No. 3: Pick on People Your Own Size.</h2>

      <p>People consistently overestimate their abilities, including the ability to resolve conflict rationally under the influence of physical factors such as hunger, tiredness, and/or anger (which also turns physical at a certain point<a href='https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0078503#:~:text=revealed%20similar%20results%2C%20compared%20to,concluded%20that%20%E2%80%98persons%20high' target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">[3]</a><a href='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7661405/#:~:text=Core%20structures%20of%20the%20brain%E2%80%99s,of%20more%20distant%20or%20possibly' target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">[4]</a>). The same applies to others: you'll always get an argument out of hungry, tired, and angry people. Too bad you'll rarely reach a resolution. Physical discomfort makes people irritable. Irritable people can't think straight enough to defend themselves. Then irritable-to-begin-with people are even more irritable for their bodies work against their better judgement. It's just not fair game.</p>

      <p>Instead, hit pause and check in on everyone before fighting. Literally ask yourself: 'Is this how I would feel about and react to the present situation if I were closer to optimal on the above axes? How about the other parties?' It all boils down to being honest about whether everyone's fit to chat <em>right now</em> or we need to postpone. Also, you want to correct for overestimating your fitness to fight—so, when in doubt, postpone. Finally, some pros will be able to continue a conversation <em>right now</em> even if they conclude it'd be better to postpone, continuously correcting for everyone's physical limitations (but I don't recommend).</p>

      <hr>

      <p>Now the above drills are not difficult to execute; the real hard bit is to catch yourself falling for any of the traps in the heat of the moment. The good news is that the self-awareness it takes not to is a trainable skill. The bad news is it won't come to you unless you practice (and fail many times before getting it right). And finally, get into the habit of saying 'I love you' after a storm—which, for the record, comes in many different shapes (e.g. 'I respect you', 'I still care', 'I'm lucky to have you'). It'll just make everyone so much less anxious to be around you, leave alone the social futures you'll earn for any interaction to come.</p>

      <p>There is something about the French bread. Somehow, whenever I land in Paris, some of my first steps always lead to a bakery. In France, fresh bread is a human right. The bread is unmistakable. It's the kind of bread that is worth one's last penny. The kind of bread that smells like breakfast with family.</p>

      <p>There is something about the way the German watch football. On football nights, six-packs of beer are sold out. On football nights, families and friends meet up over dinner and snacks, toddlers run around with their sippy cups, cheering everyone, 'Prost!' On football nights, everyone is welcome to join the party.</p>

      <p>There is something about the Dutch windmills. The wind that spins those windmills is the same wind that forces waves against the noses of the boats you can board to sail down the streets of the local towns, and the same wind that's rushing through your hair when you get a free ride in the back of a bike of a stranger. It's wind that freezes your fingertips but doesn't at all feel <em>cold</em>.</p>

      <p>There is something about planning a trip to one of the Scottish lakes and wake up the next morning just to find out that the weather laughed you out once again. Still, you can sit on a terrace of a pub, drink your glass of highland whisky, and observe, well, nothing specific—merely observe life. Never bores me.</p>

      <p>There is something about the Swiss water. It's so clean that you can see through it all the way to the very bottom of the lakes, so clean that you can most definitely drink it from any of the city fountains. There is enough for everybody. Enough to float all the swans, enough to hydrate all the mountain cows that give milk for all the cheese. Pick any kind, they're all magnificent.</p>

      <p>There is something about wandering around the tiled streets of Prague, thinking of all the rulers and tramps that once walked those streets, too. Thinking of the first time I met Mori, who ended up teaching me an important lesson on freedom, and thinking of how, no matter how endless the walk, I'll end up crashing in that one Karlin teahouse in the end.</p>

      <p>There is something about the French bread, about the Polish dill, about the Belgian chocolate, about the street music echoing through Austrian cities. There's something about adding honey to your afternoon tea in England. It's all so peaceful, so familiar, so affable. It's all so diverse, yet so united. It's all just trying to tell me one thing: <em>Welcome to Europe, dear, welcome home</em>.</p>
