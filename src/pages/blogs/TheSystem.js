<p>Let's just say I wasn't particularly impressed when I learnt that Platform 8 of the New York Penn Station, where my late-night train would depart from in just a few minutes, was not next to Platform 7, where I had just arrived. On the other hand, layovers at London Heathrow, Europe's most frequented airport, are surprisingly painless: the signage not only tells you where your gate is, it also tells you where your gate is Not (so you can get on the right track before heading to the literal end of the airport in the opposite direction). In three languages. Notice how little things make a big difference.</p>

<p>The Good Thing is that for every hiccup like that, there are about ten details that Work. I mean, stuff that is designed to keep our brains on taskâ€”rather than allow them to worry about how the task should even be accomplished or otherwise slow down performance. Stuff that is designed to obliterate friction. Both IRL and in online environments. Tap-to-pay. Soft-close drawers. Non-white whites (cause white white gives headaches but non-white white doesn't). Motion effect smoothing. It's <em>everywhere</em>. We're all a part of a System that humanity has built for <em>itself</em>.</p>

<p>The System is not simple and it's not perfect, but we trust it. For instance, we sort of believe that the London tube will take us to the correct train in the correct direction and transport us from A to B if we just show up. Our brains learn to trust the System so much that any unexpected hiccups annoy us. We can't always explain why. Sometimes it doesn't even make sense. We keep running into the same issue: We can't even imagine what the world outside the System is <em>like</em>. We process so much on the background that we can't easily verbalise yet we're hoping to define models that will fight ~fair battles.</p>

<p>However, underspecification is neither the only nor the hardest problem of the safe integration of non-human agents into the System. Here is another hurdle: the System requires successful players to chase seemingly conflicting goals. To know how to focus on a task as well as to multitask; to show flexible as well as consistent reasoning; to find rule-abiding as well as non-generic solutions. And so my hope for the research on AI is that we learn to study these trade-offs and evaluate their efficacy to develop well-calibrated, predictable, and elegant problem-solvers we owe to the future society.</p>
