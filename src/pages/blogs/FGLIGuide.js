            <p><i>The term First-Generation Low-Income (FGLI) students refers to a group of students who are the first in their immediate families to attend college or come from low-income backgrounds.</i></p>
            <p>At around this time four years ago, I had just graduated from high school and was slowly pack-ing up my whole life in the famous one suitcase to move across the ocean and pursue my (very generously sponsored) Ivy League degree. As soon as the school year kicked off though, it felt like there was a thick-ass glass wall between me and the university experience I was looking forward to: I was at a great university, but it didn’t feel like the resources were available to me. There was so much student life happening, but none of it felt like it was inviting me to have fun.</p>
            <p>Now it was not the Imposter Syndrome everyone kept warning me against—that I had been introduced to from high school and it just wasn’t <i>it</i>. It took me a while to figure out that I simply felt awfully disconnected from all these students who asked for regrades like the staff worked for them and who joined events as if on a personal invite. They all grew up overhearing their parents discuss university years. They may even have had someone splurge on their education before. They came to a top-notch university like it was at least normal or even expected. Not all of us did.</p>
            <p>This post wasn’t written to mourn the resources I myself didn’t have, nor to make recom-mendations on what institutions and families should and should not do to address the gaps between first- and continuing-generation students. It will also most certainly not contribute to fixing the status quo. This is a heartless, instrumental, solution-oriented post. A battle plan. It’s to describe the reality of navigating the Ivy League—or any good school for that matter—as a FGLI student and pass on hacks I had to learn the hard way so that whoever reads this doesn’t have to.</p>

            <div className="section-header">
                <b>Observation no. 1: </b>  You’ll Be So Risk-Averse You’ll Feel Insane.
            </div>
            <p>As a FGLI student, you know that you’re a gem. Look at how few students like you got in; sta-tistically speaking, you’ll feel like there’s no place for you. You’ll feel like you have no margin for error. You’ll refuse to step out of your comfort zone into the learning zone just to minimise the chances. There are two issues to this: (1) avoiding experiences robs you off growth, and (2) emergencies happen even if you turtle up. You are not better off running from the storm. Pre-pare for it. The best way to do so is to accept that when life happens, it’s no longer practice; it’s game time.</p>
            <p>This means you’re going to <b>locate safety nets before university even begins</b>. And I don’t mean ‘look them up online’ (though that’s a fair start). I mean stalk them, go tour relevant offices, pay attention in orientation. Many universities offer emergency funding, insurance coverage, tutoring services, free counselling, or rental computers. You want to know exactly how the process works: What is the scope of support? How do you request it? How long is the wait? Aim to minimise all friction. And prepare to get over yourself and ask for support when you need it.</p>
            <div className="section-header">
                <b>Observation no. 2: </b>  Money Will *Feel* Tighter.
            </div>

<p>Your university may hold personal finance workshops that will tell you to just sTiCk to tHE bUDgEt, and they’ll feel kind of useless because you already know that simply ‘sticking to the budget’ won’t be enough. You need that feeling to stop sitting in the back of your mind, the feeling that a single thing gone wrong will cause the rest of your world fall like dominoes, and that you’ll drown before the above-mentioned safety nets even kick in. Safety nets are designed to prevent you from <i>falling through</i>, they won’t prevent you from worrying about <i>falling down</i> to begin with.</p>
<p>Now you can either let financial anxiety eat into the time you won’t have, or you can <b>come up with a number</b>. For some, this number is derived from the expected cost of replacing a broken device, and, for some, from the cost of a last-minute flight home. In general, it should be a function of ‘What will it take to contain a disaster?’. Once you have a number, you pile up cash. You’ll have to say no to a few things for a brief time period to get there, but you’ll be able to pri-oritise classwork over working out of necessity for the rest of your studies.</p>

                <b>Observation no. 3: </b>  Your Job-Hunting Will Look Different.
            </div>

            <p> Some of your peers will have watched their families grow successful businesses, shake hands with well-placed people. Later on, even if they’re looking to land a job someplace with no connections, they’ll still know their way around accomplished people better. They’ll be more native in the language of the right… class. Meanwhile, you’ve been ripped out of your community, made the (brave) choice to leave everything and everyone you knew behind to chase a better life. Alas, few of your prior experiences and connections will help you out. </p>
            <p>Yet they’ve shaped you into the person you’ve become. You may forever speak with a little bit of an ‘accent’ out in the big world, and you may not have had the privilege of accepting unpaid internships to boost your resume because you needed to make ends meet first. However, you are tougher, more attuned now. Capitalise on it. Network. <b>Tell your story.</b> You’ll still have to knock on twice as many doors as some, but all you need is one person to notice the aptitude—the promise—your professional history may not advertise that loud, and you’ll take it from there.</p>
<div className="section-header">
                <b>Observation no. 4: </b> You’ll have little to no support from home.
            </div>

            <p>And I don’t mean financial support. I mean no one will tell you how to make professional connections, no one will give you a second opinion on coursework. In fact, most people where you come from likely won’t understand what it is that you study. And not only will you have to find someone new to turn to, you’ll <i>also</i> have to set a boundary with your family and figure out a way to not feel shit about it. They’ll want to support you even if they don’t know how, talk to you even if there’s nothing to talk about. And you know they mean well, but, some days, you’ll just be busy.</p>
            <p>You can set a boundary, but boundaries only work if you stick with them. This means that if you say that you can’t chat on such and such day and your younger sister still spams you memes, swallow the bitter pill and silence your notifications. Call back when you can. ‘How dare you?’ <b>Simply because you know your needs better than anyone. </b>(By the way, this is not to discourage you from talking to your folks—this is a reminder that prioritising them should be a choice and not the default.) In this stage of your life, you’ll need your world to revolve around you.</p>
<div className="section-header">
                <b>Observation no. 5: </b> Either you game the system, or it’ll chew you up.
            </div>
            <p>Now this is where I personally learnt my hardest lessons. I completely misunderstood that a university is not just a body of knowledge, it’s a system. For some classes it matters a great deal that you get along with the instructor, for some it matters less. Sometimes it’s better to take longer to submit more quality work even if there is a late submission penalty, sometimes you should turn in whatever you have even if it’s subpar. There are too many aspects to this, and you’ll have to figure most by yourself.</p>
            <p>I can leave you with two unsolicited pieces of advice that I remember wishing someone had told me, though. (1) <b>Your work will be assessed by humans and humans make mistakes</b>. Go ask about that half-a-point you believe you should’ve got! On a five-point quiz, that’s 10% of your grade. Even on a hundred-point exam, 0.5% can drag your whole grade down. (2) <b>Easy and fun classes go first, hard and annoying classes can wait</b>. This is because you’ll have a hard time landing your first internship as is, and a spotless record will only help you out.<a href="#footnote1" className="footnote-ref" id="ref1">[1]</a> </p>
        <div className="spacer"></div>
        <p>Two concluding notes: first, only when I got around to writing this post did I realise that I actually had very few acquaintances whose family wouldn’t be at least university-educated. Once again, this is not to say that I felt alone in any way—I have experienced very quality connections all throughout university. This is to say that maybe some of the above would have come to me a lot quicker had my friend group consisted of different demographics. In other words, in case it wasn’t obvious, take all I wrote with a pinch of salt and adjust for personal circumstances.</p>
<p>Second (and more important), though much of the above makes it look like a failure factory, the Ivy League in particular actually comes with a snapton of opportunities, many of which will be well available to FGLI students. Most universities will have excellent study abroad programmes, summer travel placements, even international for-credit courses, much of which will even be subsidised. The whole point is: understand where you come from but never let it stand in the way of where you’re headed. You have a place in the big world, don’t pass up your chance to find it. </p>

            Mario disagrees. I agree with Mario. I don’t think one should, on principle, take easy classes. I myself never took easy classes. I also remember my university’s study-abroad advisor’s look when I said I wanted to apply to study in Cambridge, UK, with my (at the time) ~3.5 GPA.
