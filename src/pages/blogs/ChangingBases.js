                The whole reason why the numerical system running the entirety of humankind is built around powers of 10 is none other than that humans have 10 fingers to count on. It’s all just PR. But to increase the rightmost digit 0 through 9 (then carry over and repeat) is not the only way to count. The binary system expresses just as rich a world as the decimal one with only 2 digits. Hex with 16.

                If you don’t know how to change bases, you should learn. Most of us were taught how all the way back in school&mdash;though, more likely than not, only very briefly. Definitely too briefly to learn The Lesson: that changing bases is not merely the ability to reorganise representations but a lot more profound skill to navigate problem spaces that are deeply unfamiliar and uncomfortably abstract.

                It’s a skill so fascinating that it’s inspired art. If you haven’t watched Arrival, again, you should. It’s a film that does what good sci-fis do, which is pick a pillar human society takes for granted and reimagine the world without it. What if the medium humans use to talk to one another is just one of many. What if language were not linear. (Sign language could teach this same lesson, by the way, but let’s not go down that rabbit hole.)

                The thing is that the ability to change bases is not just a nice-to-have anymore. It’s the bare minimum to survive in the future. Want a real-life example? Quantum computing. To even begin to grasp quantum computing, you must be able to imagine a world where you can perform linear transformations with the snap of your fingers and where basic arithmetic takes up half your CPU (QPU, whatever).

                No, wait, I can do you one better: AI. I say there is no such thing as “having a feel” for LLMs. It’s all just the capacity to switch bases and imagine what the world would be like if all you knew about it came from eavesdropping on human conversations about their experiences of the world. The whole field of AIS is built upon the question of: If you learnt about humanity from what humans have found words for, what wouldn’t you get right?

                (For what it’s worth I honestly think that if more folx fell for my change of bases propaganda, it’d solve an awful lot of society’s issues and “issues”, too. Not at all saying different people(s) aren’t entitled to their own axiological grounding, but it wouldn’t hurt if everyone stopped solving problems by projecting their own value base onto all problems in all contexts all the time.)

                My point is: solving problems you can easily grasp is not good enough anymore. The literal survival skill for the present century is the ability to step out of your comfort bubble and look at the world from a place different to the one you’ve grown so accustomed to. Too bad too few have mastered it yet. The good news is: everyone can work on it. If you’re looking for ways to best prepare for the future, this is how.</p>
